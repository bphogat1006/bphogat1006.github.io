# My Project Showcase
### A collection of JavaScript animations, games, and others programs

Using JS and p5, I have created many projects, big and small, for fun. "[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)" is a JavaScript library that allows you to use drawable elements on your html website. Using my knowledge of JS, I was able to create a large array of projects ranging from physics simulations, to games, to mathematical animations and others.

This site is a work in progress that I am using to cleanly showcase a selection of my projects.

## Progress & Plans

Currently, I have completed a clean home page design with animations and links to each project. I have a large selection of projects that I am still working on importing into the website. The current actual project files are located within /assets/common/js/p5/. I have restructured the website in a way that will make adding new projects quick and seamless to speed up the process. Rather than having an html page for each project, there is now one page which dynamically loads whichever p5 sketch the user picks.

As my project list grows, I will implement a filter on the home page that lets you view projects based on tags, such as "animation", "interactive", "natural", etc.

Later, I will add buttons in the top right corner of each project subpage for a few different purposes:
- back to home button
- info button with a text pop-up detailing what the project does, and how to use it (if it is interactive)
- refresh button
- view source code button
