# My Project Showcase
### A collection of JavaScript animations, games, and others programs

Using JS and p5, I have created many projects, big and small, for fun. "[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)" is a JavaScript library that allows you to use drawable elements on your html website. Using my knowledge of JS, I was able to create a large array of projects ranging from physics simulations, to games, to mathematical animations and others.

This site is a work in progress that I am using to cleanly showcase a selection of my projects.

## Progress & Plans

I have a large selection of projects that I plan to import into the website, and I am currently working on this transition. The actual project files are located within /assets/common/js/p5-projects/.

At the same time, I am developing a basic home page with links to subpages for each project for easy viewing. After this, I will style the page with CSS.
